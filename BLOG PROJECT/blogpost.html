        Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites.
        In 1995, the "Online Diary" on the Ty, Inc. Web site was produced and
        updated manually before any blogging programs were available. Posts were
        made to appear in reverse chronological order by manually updating
        text-based HTML code using FTP software in real time several times a
        day. To users, this offered the appearance of a live diary that
        contained multiple new entries per day. At the beginning of each new
        day, new diary entries were manually coded into a new HTML file, and at
        the start of each month, diary entries were archived into their own
        folder, which contained a separate HTML page for every day of the month.
        Then, menus that contained links to the most recent diary entry were
        updated manually throughout the site. This text-based method of
        organizing thousands of files served as a springboard to define future
        blogging styles that were captured by blogging software developed years
        later.[13] The evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate
        the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse
        chronological order made the publishing process feasible for a much
        larger and less technically-inclined population. Ultimately, this
        resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs
        we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based
        software is now a typical aspect of "blogging". Blogs can be hosted by
        dedicated blog hosting services, on regular web hosting services, or run
        using blog software. Early blogs were simply manually updated components
